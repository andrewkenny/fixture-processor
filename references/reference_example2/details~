fixture/fixture.o.  However, it is not in any requirements file, and it 
is not in the old wirelist.  No wires are being generated for this node. 
Check the fixture file, the old wirelist, and the test sources to make sure 
that the node names are correct.  Make sure that the appropriate .r files 
exist. (WARNING MPA404)
